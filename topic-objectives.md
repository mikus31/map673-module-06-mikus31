[USA Ultimate](http://www.usaultimate.org/index.html), the governing body for the sport of ultimate frisbee in the United States, hosted its annual college championships tournament on Memorial Day weekend. It's a highly-anticipated event among many in the ultimate community, and there are several websites and blogs that chronicle the season and cover the championships. One blog in particular, [Bama Secs](http://www.bamasecs.com/), produces [static web maps](https://twitter.com/bamasecs/status/867441795520753666) that show (1) field number locations and (2) game matchups per round. Within this data is a distinction, by color, between men's and women's games.
